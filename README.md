Blue square: Agent<br>
Green square:  Food<br>
Red square: Enemy<br>

In this app, a "Blue" agent has to survive from a "Red" enemy and fetch the desired "Green" food. I have used Deep Reinforcement Learning to train the agent to achieve this goal.

It takes a total of 40,000 episodes to train the agent. However, in some cases you may see agent falls in the hand of enemy or agent may be stuck in corners. Maybe, I have to train more to achieve better accuracy.
